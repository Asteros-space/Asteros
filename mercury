        <br>Year: About 88 Earth days.<br><br>
        Day: About 59 Earth days.<br><br>
        Diameter: About 3,000, less than half of Earth's.<br><br>

        Sun-scorched Mercury, the smallest planet in our solar system, is only slightly larger than Earth's moon. Like the moon, Mercury has very little atmosphere to stop impacts and it is covered with craters. Mercury's dayside is super-heated by the sun, but at night temperatures drop hundreds of degrees below freezing. Ice may even exist in craters.
